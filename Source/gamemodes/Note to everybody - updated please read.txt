The 'odometer' code is really lagging the gameplay.
I have around 700 miliseconds lag before a command reaches the server.
You can better improve this code or use a timer.

Hey guys,
If you all are avaible this saturday for some team coding we could most likely
complete the whole CnR mini mode. I am hoping to be able to give the CnR
a facelift. Get some code written in, interiors, banks, police stations, etc. If
either of you guys can't make it, we can reschedule to a later date.
