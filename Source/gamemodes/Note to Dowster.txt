Hey, sent you a PM couple of minutes before this note has been placed. But
i no longer need help with setting up this SVN stuff. Anyways, hopefully getting
back to coding this weekend haven't coded anything in awhile. So this could be
a little interesting. Other than that looking forward to talking to you later.
